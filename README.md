# Proto264
Proto264 is an Open Hardware prototyping board for the Expansion port of the Commodore 16, 114 and Plus/4 computers

## Summary
*This board does NOTHING out-of-the box*, it's meant to be the first brick upon which you can prototype your own Expansion port-based designs.

It's basically a matrix of 2.54mm-spaced soldering points with easy access to all the signals available and plenty of power points. With a few wires you can easily build anything you have in mind.

You can also solder a 2.54mm pin header so that you can easily connect Dupont headers, scope/logic analyzer probes, etc.

The TOP side is clearly indicated in order to avoid plugging it upside-down, please pay attention to that!

If you think you need more solder points, keep in mind that this board was sized just under 10x10cm in order to allow it to be produced cheaply (you can get 10 for $5 from PCBWay, see [below](#support-the-project)).

## Releases
If you want to get this board produced, you are recommended to get [the latest release](https://github.com/SukkoPera/Proto264/releases) rather than the current git version, as the latter might be under development and is not guaranteed to be working.

Every release is accompanied by its Bill Of Materials (BOM) file and any relevant notes about it, which you are recommended to read carefully.
